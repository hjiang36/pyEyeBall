Installation
============

Currently, we are still testing with Python Package Index on its test site.
To install pyEyeBall, use command

``pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi pyEyeBall``

In the future, we will move it to Python Package Index main site and by then, you could install with

``pip install pyEyeBall``
